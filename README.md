## Demo of Akka Streams

---

### Introduction

This small demo project illustrates the utilization of Akka Streams for audio processing.

It's a multi-project sbt build that builds audio echo generators:

1. The first one uses a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter approach
2. The second one uses an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filter approach

Both approaches utilize filters with a low number of tap points and large delays (in the order of several 100ms)

The goal is come up with generic filters that can be chained and, if the filter elements are chosen with care, to be able to remove echos that are generated by a first filter with a second filter.
