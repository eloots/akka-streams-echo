## Demo of Akka Streams

---

### Introduction

This small demo project illustrates the utilisation of Akka Streams for audio processing.

It's a multi-project sbt build that builds:

1. An echo generator using a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter
2. An echo generator using an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filter approach
3. We show that, when an appropriately configured filter is added, echo's
   introduced by a preceding filter can be eliminated completely
4. A Voltage Controlled Oscillator
5. Demonstrates merging two streams that have different flow rates

Both the IIR and FIR utilise filters with a low number of tap points and large delays (in the order of several 100ms)

The goal is come up with generic filters that can be chained and, if the filter elements are chosen with care, to be able to remove echoes that are generated by a first filter with a second filter.
