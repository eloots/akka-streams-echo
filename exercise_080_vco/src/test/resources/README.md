## Building a Voltage Controlled Oscillator

In this step, we build the software equivalent of a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO). Of course, we won't use a real voltage, but instead use a digital equivalent. The VCO will generate a wave (in stead state, this will be a sampled sin-wave) and the frequency of that wave will be controlled by an input value: a Double between 0.0d and 1.0d
