initial-state

## Exercise 0 > Initial State

Before we begin coding, we need to analyze the provided code in detail and verify that the initial state is working as expected.

- Form groups of three to five students. This is the structure we use for the rest of the course.
- Focus on the three main components; **game engine**, **player registry**, and the **scores repository**.
- After reviewing the code, choose a team member to: 
    - Describe the **message** flows.
    - Identify risks for **high** availability.
    - Identify potential solutions.
    - Collect any question you might have.

After you have completed the above steps, do the following:

- Use the `test` command to verify the initial state works as expected. You should see something like the following:

```scala
[info] Run completed in 355 milliseconds.
[info] Total number of tests run: 9
[info] Suites: completed 2, aborted 0
[info] Tests: succeeded 9, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 1 s, ...
```

- Use the `koan next` command to move to the next exercise.
